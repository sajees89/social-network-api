# NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Description
This week's challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friend's thoughts, and create a friend list.
Used Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and the Mongoose ODM. Since the application wasn't deployed, testing and the video walkthrough were completed in Insomnia.

## User Story

AS A social media startup  
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database  
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data  

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API  
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application  
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database  
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts  
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON  
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core  
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database  
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core  
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
